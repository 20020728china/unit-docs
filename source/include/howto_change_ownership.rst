Set installation path permissions to secure access, for example:

.. code-block:: console

   # chown -R :nxt_term:`app_user:app_group <Application-specific user and group names such as www-data:www-data>` :nxt_term:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application files such as /data/www/app/>`

Update the placeholders above with actual values, noting them for later use in
Unit configuration.
